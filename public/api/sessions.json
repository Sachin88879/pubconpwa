It is called their internal algorithm, and it's not that dissimilar from ranking on Google. Once Amazon's algorithm kicks in, you could see a boatload of free promotion come your way from Amazon. Optimize your Amazon page: what you must do to start showing up in more searches  Understand categories/themes and how to rank consistently #1 in your category. Kindle Unlimited: How some authors are making a fortune here and how you can, too.  How to quadruple the reviews you get on Amazon.  Why having a free book will help you sell more.",

SEO can take some (if not the bulk) of the responsibility for much of the bad content online, and it is SEO that can turn everything around.
